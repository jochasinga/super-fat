Super Fat: Furby Chat Client
============================

This repository is dedicated to code for "Super Fat" Toy Project to be presented and exhibited at the Makerfaire NY on September 20-21, 2014. Contributions are super-appreciated and contributors will be definitely be mentioned.

Project Description
===================

*Super Fat* is an speculative attempt to treat a toy object as a "fat" web chat client as opposed to the "thin" web client in the usually MVC paradigm. By being "fat" it simply means that more computing is moved into the client from the server or cloud, and by being "super fat" is actually making that computing physical.

Requirements
============

+ [Meteor.js](http://example.com/ "Meteor") for the chat client
+ (possibly)[Famo.us](https://famo.us/ "Famo.us") for its UI
+ [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/ "Arduino") for the toy
+ [Cellv1.0](http://www.sparqee.com/portfolio/sparqee-cell/ "Sparqee Cellv1.0") for 3G communication
